This website would not be possible without the work of the Wax project, used for producing digital exhibitions focused on longevity, low costs, and flexibility.

Wax is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led and maintained by [Marii Nyrop](https://marii.info/) and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex).

It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) and builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.

For more on working with Wax, visit the [documentation wiki](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/).
