### Salvete!
This is the homepage for The Solar Imperium Dungeons & Dragons campaign. Players can find direct links to resources used by the campaign here, such as setting and crafting PDF's. As the weeks and sessions accumulate, a collection of their discoveries and exploits will be added. It is my hope to regularly update these pages with maps, artifacts, and documents from their adventures. If my ambition does not outstrip my time, I will also add sections describing the myths and history from the Mediterranean that inspires these adventures!
